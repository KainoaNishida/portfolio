  intro: "this is where i'll start journaling—a place to jot down what I'm learning, what's working, and what isn't. writing helps me make sense of tricky ideas, track my progress, and hopefully share something useful with anyone on a similar path. whether I'm breaking down a tough problem, exploring a new concept, or reflecting on an experience, think of this as both my personal notebook and a resource you're welcome to borrow from.",
