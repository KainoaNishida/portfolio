    "aloha! i'm kai, and i love building things.",
    "i'm a student at the university of california, irvine. i've worked as a software development engineer intern at amazon, a software engineer with commit the change partnering with local nonprofits, and a researcher in the zhang lab applying machine learning and deep learning to biology.",
    "i also really love math. on the left, you can find a bit of this passion in the form of fermi questions (yes, the code loc's are also fermi questions, so they may not be exactly on the dot)",
    "another thing i love to do is teach others. it's an experience like no other, being able to work together with others to solve complex problems. i've done this as an education director for commit the change where i led workshops and lectures to teach basic programming things such as typescript, git, relational databases, and the sdlc. i've also done this as a learning assistant for cs 161, our pivotal design and analysis of algorithms course at uci where we go over complex topics such as flow, dynamic programming, and divide and conquer.",
    "i'm excited about thoughtful software, learning new tools, and connecting with people. when i'm not coding, i'm gaming with friends, bouldering, outside somewhere, or getting a little too competitive on the soccer field.",
    "while this site started as a portfolio, i'd like to turn it into a journal. feel free to poke around - projects, research, skills, background - it's all here."
